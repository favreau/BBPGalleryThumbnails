As part of the Blue Brain Project, a selection of images and videos has been made publicly available under the CC BY 4.0 License. This project showcases the thumbnails I created over the years (2014â€“2024) using [Blue Brain Brayns 1.1.0](https://github.com/BlueBrain/Brayns/tree/1.1.0) until 2019, and [Blue Brain BioExplorer](https://github.com/BlueBrain/BioExplorer) from 2020 onward.
